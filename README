Released 20100629 - Garrett Honeycutt - GPLv2

postfix            - base class common for all postfix types
postfix::client    - used on all clients
postfix::rt        - mail server for RT (Request Tracker)
postfix::pflogsumm - pflogsumm for postfix stats


This class needs to be refactored. There are a lot of things going on in this module
that I am not too pleased with, however it does work quite well and has been used in
many production environments.
